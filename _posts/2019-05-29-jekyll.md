## How do you even?
Playing with Jekyll now to see if I like it. Writing markdown is definitely nicer than html.

### Code
Let's try to display some code. This is github, right? It should be easy:
```rust
pub fn main() -> Result<(), JsValue> {
}
```

### Math
Okay, I don't even expect this to work. I just want it.
Here we go: $$\forall x \in R$$
It doesn't work. I can't get it to work. Why doesn't it work!? ðŸ˜­
