# How do you even?
Playing with Jekyll now to see if I like it. Writing markdown is definitely nicer than html.

## Code
Let's try to display some code. This is github, right? It should be easy:
```rust
pub fn main() -> Result<(), JsValue> {
}
```

## Math
Okay, I don't even expect this to work. I just want it. Here we go: $$a^2 + b^2 = \ldots$$
